# Pentatonic
Automate you're learning. Presenting a flashcard learning app which generates the flashcards for you, from your notes, with AI.

---

## Inspiration
We are students and have lots of notes and want to revise with them. Making flashcards takes lots of time, which this saves.

## What it does
We have built a flashcard app, which presents flashcards in groups, and generates flashcards for you from your notes

## How we built it
We thoroughly designed the product, and tested the natural language processing API to ensure that the idea would be feasible. We then began coding the project, splitting up the different components into front and back end and then didn't sleep.

## Challenges we ran into
Dealing with CORS errors. Initially we desigined the system to have different users using AUTH0, however after spending multiple hours on this, we had to focus our efforts on the core system

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have built a full stack flashcard app from scratch. The AI which generates the flashcards works well enough and we have achieved our aim of creating an automated flashcard system.

## What we learned
We learnt how to use the cohere API, make a full stack app integrating front and back end, had further experience with software engineering design including UML, and further experience with FLASK, python, REACT JS, Typescript, and databases.

## What's next for pentatonic
We will complete the app to support multiple users and provide a better user experience.

## NB: Git Squashed Repo
After some API key issues meaning they were accidently pushed into the main repository, the public version will be shown here without the API keys present.
